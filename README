Digilines Stuff
===============


License:
Code - LGPL v3 or later (contains some code from mesecons and digilines)
Textures - CC BY-SA 3.0 Generic (contains modified versions of textures from mesecons and digilines)


Depends:
Required: digilines (base only) and mesecons (base only)
Only needed for craft recipes: default and mesecons_luacontroller


How to use digilines buttons:
Connect to a digiline (or digimese), right-click, and set a channel and message.
When the button is pressed (right-click), it will send that message on that channel, over digilines.
Note that the settings cannot be changed after setting - you must dig and re-place the button to do so.


How to use digimese:
It conducts digilines signals (like digilines) in all directions (like mese). That's about it, really.
